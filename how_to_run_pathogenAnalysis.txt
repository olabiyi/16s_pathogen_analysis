#requirements for running pathogen analysis on my water samples

#step 1
#get all the pathogens sequences

Which identity threshold do you want?
options are 0 to 10 for 90 to 100% identity, respectively
8

#step 4
#load pathogen_analysis_functions.R

#step 5
# the the necessary variables andtthen source the pathogen_analysis.R script
