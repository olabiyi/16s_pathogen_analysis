#Below are instructions on how to search for pathogens using the the scripts provided in this repository
#please note that the scripts can also be used to search for anything within your OTU table
#all you need is to feed it with the right database, sequences and correct labels.

#Dependencies
# Either installing QIIME 1.9.1 or getting the following scripts from that QIIME version
# ~ extract_seqs_by_sample_id.py
# ~ filter_taxa_from_otu_table.py
# ~ biom
# ~ filter_fasta.py

#note - $> represents the bash comand prompt
##### step 1
#get the pathogens sequences by running the get_seq.sh script as shown below
$>get_seq.sh

#you will be prompted as follows - below I give an example on how to respond to the questions 

what are you looking for?:
pathogens

Enter the full path to the file containing the comma separated list of what you are looking for:
/gpfs0/biores/users/gilloro/Biyi/pathogen_analysis/silva_human_pathogens.txt

Enter the full path to the OTU.biom file:
/gpfs0/biores/users/gilloro/Biyi/community_analysis/water/05.open_ref_otus/bac_open_ref_otus/water_otu_table.biom

Enter the full path to the seqs_otus.txt file:
/gpfs0/biores/users/gilloro/Biyi/community_analysis/water/05.open_ref_otus/bac_open_ref_otus/final_otu_map_mc2.txt

Enter the full path to the seqs.fna file:
/gpfs0/biores/users/gilloro/Biyi/community_analysis/water/03.demultiplexed/bacteria_demultiplexed/non_chimeric_seqs.fna


##### step 2
#get the sample names by running the get_samples.sh script as follows
$>source get_samples.sh



##### step 3
#blast the sequences
$>blast_sequences.sh ${samples[*]}

#you will be prompted as follows - below I give an example on how to respond to the questions
#in the example below I choose an identity threshold of 98% 

what are you searching for:

Enter the full path to the blast database:
/gpfs0/biores/users/gilloro/Biyi/REF_SEQ_16s_microbial/refseq_16s
Enter the full path to the fasta file of what you want to search for:
/gpfs0/biores/users/gilloro/Biyi/community_analysis/water/09.pathogen_analysis/pathogens.fasta
Enter the column name in your mapping file to be analysed:
sample
What will you like to call the file that will contain your combined results?
result_together
Which identity threshold do you want?
options are 0 to 10 for 90 to 100% identity, respectively
8



#### for instructions on how to run steps 1 - 3 in one go via qsub see the pathogens_search.sh script



################### Collate your results in R  OR Python ###############################

#note - R> represents the R command prompt
######### In R
#### step 4
#load the functions needed to collate the results in R

R>source('pathogen_analysis_functions.R') 

##### step 5
# set the necessary variables and then source the pathogen_analysis.R script
# Please see the script for instructions on how to set the required variables

####### In Python
# Make sure the pathogenAnalysisFunctions.py and Pathogen_analysis.py scripts are in the same working directory
# Open the Pathogen_analysis.py scipt set the require input variable at the top of the script, then run.
# Please make sure you have all the necessary modules installed. The script was tested on Python 3.6.8
