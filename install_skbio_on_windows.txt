# How to Install Scikit-Bio on Windows
In order to install and use modules like ecopy and skbio on Windows you'll need to 
download and install visual studio 2015

1. From this link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44290672/
   how-to-download-visual-studio-community-edition-2015-not-2017

Downdload the web installer or iso for windows. 
After this must have installed (it takes a few hours).

2. Then run the command 
a. 'pip install msgpack' in the Anaconda prompt
b. 'pip install ecopy' in the Anaconda prompt

To get a work around version of scikit bio for Windows follow the instructions
 below:

1. Install Windows Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition with C++ SDK enabled to
   meet the requirements of the compiler for installing the package(Scikit-Bio) 
   from the link https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532606&clcid=0x409 
   (web installer)

2. Download the latest source from the Scikit-bio Github repository  
   https://github.com/biocore/scikit-bio/archive/master.zip.

3. Using a tool like 7-zip, unpack it into your python packages directory
   (C:\Users\user\Anaconda3\pkgs).

3. Open a command line client (cmd) and navigate to the source directory
   i.e. the uzipped folder.
   cd C:\Users\user\Anaconda3\pkgs\scikit-bio-master


4. Using Notepad++ edit the setup.py file
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++" setup.py
  Find the line in which the variable ssw_extra_compile_args 
  is defined and change it. You can comment on the previous version and 
  redefine the variable in the new line:

  #ssw_extra_compile_args = ['-Wno-error=declaration-after-statement']
  ssw_extra_compile_args = []

5. Save the changes, close the editor and start the installation with
   this command:
   python setup.py install
  I hope you do not receive error messages.

6. Exit from the directory that you insatlled skbio into
   cd C:\Users\user\Documents

7. Open an Anaconda Python session (using the command python) and check if 
   Scikit-Bio was installed correctly using print(skbio.art).
   test insatllation
  import skbio
  print(skbio.art)
